# Euro Exchange Rates by ECB for Node RED

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org) plugin to retrieve Euro foreign exchange reference rates from an [API](http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html) provided by the European Central Bank.

Based on my [ecb-euro-exchange-rates](https://github.com/qqilihq/ecb-euro-exchange-rates) module.

This serves as my “hello world” to learn how to build Node RED nodes. Most steps are simply following the [“Create your first node”](https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/first-node) tutorial, additionally I used the `@types/node-red` to write this in TS.
